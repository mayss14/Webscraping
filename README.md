# Web Scraping with Python
Web scraping with Python allowed  me to extract data from websites for analysis, data collection, or building datasets. 

Python's libraries like BeautifulSoup and pandas provided tools to parse HTML and navigate webpage structures, while Requests handles HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.

Using these tools, helped me  identify specific elements on a page, retrieve the data, and clean it for further use.
